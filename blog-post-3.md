# AI Builder Integration Issues: Getting Unstuck with AI-Powered Development

AI builders like Bubble, Webflow, and similar tools are revolutionizing development, but they come with their own set of challenges. Here are the most common AI builder issues and how to solve them.

## 1. API Integration Failures

**The Problem:** Your AI builder can't connect to external services or APIs.

**Common Issues:**

- CORS errors blocking API calls
- Authentication problems with third-party services
- Rate limiting from external APIs
- Incorrect API endpoint configurations

**Quick Fix:**

```javascript
// Handle CORS issues in your API calls
const apiCall = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data", {
      method: "GET",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
        // Add CORS headers if needed
      },
      mode: "cors", // Explicitly set CORS mode
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`API call failed: ${response.status}`);
    }

    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("API Integration Error:", error);
    // Implement fallback logic
  }
};
```

## 2. Database Schema Conflicts

**The Problem:** Your AI builder's database structure doesn't match your requirements.

**Signs You Have This Issue:**

- Data not saving correctly
- Relationships between tables not working
- Import/export failures
- Performance issues with complex queries

**Quick Fix:**

```sql
-- Audit your current schema
SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'your_database';

-- Add missing indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_date ON orders(user_id, created_at);

-- Fix relationship constraints
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_orders_user
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id);
```

## 3. Custom Code Integration Problems

**The Problem:** Your custom JavaScript/HTML doesn't work properly within the AI builder.

**Common Issues:**

- JavaScript conflicts with builder's framework
- CSS styling overrides
- Event handling problems
- Third-party library compatibility

**Quick Fix:**

```javascript
// Use namespacing to avoid conflicts
window.MyCustomApp = window.MyCustomApp || {};

MyCustomApp.init = function () {
  // Wait for AI builder to be ready
  if (typeof window.AIBuilder !== "undefined") {
    // Your custom code here
    this.setupEventListeners();
    this.initializeComponents();
  } else {
    // Retry after a short delay
    setTimeout(() => MyCustomApp.init(), 100);
  }
};

// Initialize when DOM is ready
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  MyCustomApp.init();
});
```

## 4. Performance Issues with Complex Workflows

**The Problem:** Your AI builder app becomes slow with complex logic and workflows.

**Signs:**

- Slow page loads
- Workflow steps timing out
- High memory usage
- Browser crashes

**Quick Fix:**

```javascript
// Optimize workflow execution
const optimizedWorkflow = async (data) => {
  // Break complex workflows into smaller chunks
  const chunks = this.chunkArray(data, 100);

  for (const chunk of chunks) {
    await this.processChunk(chunk);
    // Add delay to prevent overwhelming the system
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 50));
  }
};

// Implement caching for expensive operations
const cache = new Map();
const cachedOperation = (key, operation) => {
  if (cache.has(key)) {
    return cache.get(key);
  }

  const result = operation();
  cache.set(key, result);
  return result;
};
```

## 5. Deployment and Environment Issues

**The Problem:** Your app works locally but breaks in production.

**Common Issues:**

- Environment variable differences
- Database connection problems
- File path issues
- SSL/HTTPS configuration problems

**Quick Fix:**

```javascript
// Environment-specific configuration
const config = {
  development: {
    apiUrl: "http://localhost:3000/api",
    database: "dev_database",
    debug: true,
  },
  production: {
    apiUrl: "https://api.yourdomain.com",
    database: "prod_database",
    debug: false,
  },
};

const currentConfig = config[process.env.NODE_ENV || "development"];

// Use configuration throughout your app
const apiCall = async (endpoint) => {
  const response = await fetch(`${currentConfig.apiUrl}${endpoint}`);
  return response.json();
};
```
