# 5 Common React Bugs That Are Costing Your Business Money

React is powerful, but when it breaks, it can bring your entire application to a halt. Here are the most common React bugs I see businesses struggling with and how to fix them.

## 1. Component Not Re-rendering After State Update

**The Problem:** Your component updates state but the UI doesn't reflect the changes.

**Common Causes:**

- Mutating state directly instead of using setState
- Not using the spread operator for objects/arrays
- Forgetting to include all properties when updating state

**Quick Fix:**

```javascript
// ❌ Wrong - mutating state directly
this.state.user.name = "John";

// ✅ Correct - using setState
this.setState((prevState) => ({
  user: { ...prevState.user, name: "John" },
}));
```

## 2. Memory Leaks in useEffect

**The Problem:** Your app gets slower over time and eventually crashes.

**Common Causes:**

- Not cleaning up event listeners
- Forgetting to return cleanup function in useEffect
- Setting state on unmounted components

**Quick Fix:**

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const handleResize = () => setWindowSize(window.innerWidth);
  window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);

  // ✅ Always clean up
  return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
}, []);
```

## 3. Infinite Re-render Loops

**The Problem:** Your component keeps re-rendering infinitely, freezing the browser.

**Common Causes:**

- Creating new objects/arrays in render
- Missing dependency arrays in useEffect
- Circular dependencies between components

**Quick Fix:**

```javascript
// ❌ Wrong - creates new object every render
const user = { name: "John", age: 30 };

// ✅ Correct - use useMemo or move outside component
const user = useMemo(() => ({ name: "John", age: 30 }), []);
```

## 4. Props Not Updating Child Components

**The Problem:** Child components don't update when parent props change.

**Common Causes:**

- Using React.memo incorrectly
- Not passing all required props
- Props being overridden by local state

**Quick Fix:**

```javascript
// ✅ Use React.memo properly
const ChildComponent = React.memo(
  ({ data }) => {
    return <div>{data}</div>;
  },
  (prevProps, nextProps) => {
    return prevProps.data === nextProps.data;
  }
);
```

## 5. Event Handler Context Issues

**The Problem:** 'this' is undefined in your event handlers.

**Common Causes:**

- Not binding methods in constructor
- Using arrow functions incorrectly
- Losing context in callbacks

**Quick Fix:**

```javascript
// ✅ Use arrow functions for class methods
handleClick = () => {
  this.setState({ clicked: true });
};

// ✅ Or bind in constructor
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
}
```
