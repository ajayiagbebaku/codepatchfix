# Database Performance Issues: The Hidden Killer of Your Business

Your database is the backbone of your business. When it's slow, everything slows down - and that costs you money. Here are the most common database performance issues and how to fix them.

## 1. Missing Database Indexes

**The Problem:** Queries that should take milliseconds are taking seconds or minutes.

**Signs You Have This Issue:**

- Slow page loads
- Timeout errors
- High CPU usage on database server
- Queries taking longer than expected

**Quick Fix:**

```sql
-- Check for slow queries
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';

-- Add index if missing
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);

-- For composite queries
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_date ON orders(user_id, order_date);
```

## 2. N+1 Query Problem

**The Problem:** Your application is making hundreds of database calls when it should only make a few.

**Example of the Problem:**

```javascript
// ❌ Bad - N+1 queries
users.forEach((user) => {
  const orders = db.query("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = ?", [user.id]);
  // This runs N times!
});

// ✅ Good - Single query with JOIN
const usersWithOrders = db.query(`
  SELECT u.*, o.* 
  FROM users u 
  LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
`);
```

## 3. Database Connection Pool Exhaustion

**The Problem:** Your app runs out of database connections and starts failing.

**Signs:**

- "Too many connections" errors
- Random database failures
- Slow response times under load

**Quick Fix:**

```javascript
// Configure connection pool properly
const pool = mysql.createPool({
  host: "localhost",
  user: "username",
  password: "password",
  database: "mydb",
  connectionLimit: 10, // Adjust based on your needs
  acquireTimeout: 60000, // 60 seconds
  timeout: 60000, // 60 seconds
  reconnect: true,
});
```

## 4. Large Result Sets

**The Problem:** Loading too much data at once, causing memory issues and slow performance.

**Signs:**

- Memory usage spikes
- Slow page loads
- Browser crashes with large datasets

**Quick Fix:**

```sql
-- Use pagination
SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20 OFFSET 0;

-- Use specific columns instead of *
SELECT id, name, price FROM products
WHERE category = 'electronics';
```

## 5. Database Lock Contention

**The Problem:** Multiple processes are trying to access the same data, causing deadlocks.

**Signs:**

- Random query failures
- "Deadlock detected" errors
- Inconsistent data

**Quick Fix:**

```sql
-- Use transactions properly
BEGIN;
UPDATE users SET last_login = NOW() WHERE id = 123;
UPDATE user_stats SET login_count = login_count + 1 WHERE user_id = 123;
COMMIT;

-- Add proper error handling
try {
  await db.transaction(async (trx) => {
    await trx('users').where('id', userId).update({ last_login: new Date() });
    await trx('user_stats').where('user_id', userId).increment('login_count');
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (error.code === 'ER_LOCK_DEADLOCK') {
    // Retry logic here
  }
}
```

## The Business Impact of Database Issues

Poor database performance directly affects your bottom line:

- **Lost Revenue:** Slow checkout processes drive customers away
- **Increased Costs:** Higher server costs from inefficient queries
- **Customer Complaints:** Poor user experience leads to support tickets
- **Developer Time:** Hours wasted debugging instead of building features

## When Database Issues Need Professional Help

Consider professional database optimization when:

- **Queries take longer than 1 second** regularly
- **You're getting timeout errors** during peak usage
- **Database server CPU is consistently high** (>80%)
- **You're experiencing random failures** under load
- **Your team spends more time debugging** than building
